&lt;p>I thought the only way to write and publish articles on Medium would be through blogging platforms or solutions like Hugo static site generators. However, since I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the Joplin app for some time now, I&amp;rsquo;ve been wondering if there might be a way to publish directly from Joplin to GitHub and then, possibly, to Medium through actions. This seems like a solid solution, especially considering there&amp;rsquo;s a plugin developed by the user RXliuli that fits the use case well. All I need to do is find an action that can utilize any existing Medium API for publishing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The revolution will be complete when the language is perfect</title><link>/posts/language-perfect/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/language-perfect/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="he-moved-over-to-the-window">He moved over to the window&lt;/h2>

The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable. The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed) but there was no way of shutting it off completely.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sanity is not statistical</title><link>/posts/sanity-not-statistical/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/sanity-not-statistical/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="there-was-no-way-of-knowing-whose-version-would-finally-be-adopted">There was no way of knowing whose version would finally be adopted&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Once again he glanced at his rival in the opposite cubicle. Something seemed to tell him with certainty that Tillotson was busy on the same job as himself. There was no way of knowing whose version would finally be adopted, but he felt a profound conviction that it would be his own&lt;/p>
