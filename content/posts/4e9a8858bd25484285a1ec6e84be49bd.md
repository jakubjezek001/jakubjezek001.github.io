I thought the only way to write and publish articles on Medium would be through blogging platforms or solutions like Hugo static site generators. However, since I've been using the Joplin app for some time now, I've been wondering if there might be a way to publish directly from Joplin to GitHub and then, possibly, to Medium through actions. This seems like a solid solution, especially considering there's a plugin developed by the user RXliuli that fits the use case well. All I need to do is find an action that can utilize any existing Medium API for publishing.

There was one action I found for the previous idea, considering using Hugo as my blog content platform. Someone had written an action for publishing Hugo to Medium (<https://github.com/pr4k/hugo-to-medium>) some time ago. However, upon researching the Python module used for Medium, I discovered it is no longer maintained. This has led me to be suspicious about the accessibility of Medium's API. An article on the Unofficial Medium API explains the situation quite well. \[Here the Unoficial Medium API article].(<https://mediumapi.com/frequently-asked-questions.html>)
