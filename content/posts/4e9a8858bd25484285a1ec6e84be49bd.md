# Joplin Publisher | Joplin Utils

<https://joplin-utils.rxliuli.com/en-US/joplin-publisher/>

At first I was thinking that the only way to write and publish articles to Medium would be via usage of blogging platforms or solutions like Hugo static site generators, but since I am  years hooked on Joplin app I was wandering weather there wouldn't be some way to publish directly from Joplin to GitHub and then perhaps somehow via actions to Medium. It seems to be pretty solid solution since there is the mentioned plugin developed by RXliuli user and it is decent for the use case. I only need to find an action which would be using any existent medium api for publishing.

There was one action I have found for the previous idea where I was considering Hugo to be my blog content platform and someone had written long time ago an action for publishing Hugo to Medium <https://github.com/pr4k/hugo-to-medium>. But as I was researching the used Medium Python module it is no longer maintained and I am bit suspicious that Medium is not having any decent API access. [Here the Unoficial Medium API article](https://mediumapi.com/frequently-asked-questions.html) explains quite well the situation.

So after todays research I had figured out following:

- need to use this theme <https://statisticalbias.com/publishing/>
- need to publish pages as Hugo because Hexo was not reliable. Hugo seems to have bigger community and themes are nicer
- Joplin plugin por publishing to Hexo is ideal but needs to be rewritten to publish into Hugo.
- there is perhaps even better solution and it is to rewrite following plugin  <https://github.com/aman-d-1-n-only/joplin-exports-to-ssg/tree/main> and this <https://github.com/tluyben/joplin2hugo>. It is much better because it is more simple and it could be just about adding config page and improving UX of popup dialogue page.
- here is Hugo GH action for deploying GH pages <https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-hugo>
- And here is how to start with Joplin plugin development <https://joplinapp.org/help/api/get_started/plugins/>

### continuation day 03

- Hugo site finally created
- found pretty decent Theme. Hugo-winston-theme.
- some changes had been done on the theme so it is titting more my style.

### continuation day 04

- looking into ways of api access for Linked IN posts publishing.
- here is a useful post about LI python post publishing <https://blog.futuresmart.ai/how-to-automate-your-linkedin-posts-using-python-and-the-linkedin-api>
- I had realized that I will also need to find a way for parsing markdown frontmatter in python <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50041649/python-get-json-frontmatter-from-markdown-file> . That will be the only way for reading tags so the process can identify those to be submitted to Medium a or LinkedIn.
- now the question is how to quickly figure out those articles which where already published and those **which** were not so it doesn't always need to parse tags from all post files. Perhaps a json file with stored files could be saved into `/resources/published-files.json` folder and after each publish is complete it could be dumped into it. Or even to have own text file with all processed files for each platform for example `/resources/published-medium.txt`. this way asynchronous processing for each platform could be executed.
- but it would need to be committed every time it is publishing anything and we would end up with circular loop for GH workflow. Or perhaps there is a way GH workflow could it cach it?
- Joplin plugin settings attribute will need to have enumerated options. Here is an example on how to do it <https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/11b33474b7e6efcb1b03e3dc474a2a7efcaf6647/packages/app-cli/tests/support/plugins/settings/src/index.ts#L20>
- on compilation of joplin plugins with JPL cli tool <https://www.npmjs.com/package/joplin-plugin-cli>
- the publishing plugin in Joplin should commit each md file in separate commit and format message the way it could be catched by medium script

### continuation day 04

- Yeeeess it works! I have managed to enhance the Joplin Publisher plugin the way it is now publishing to my web.
- Now I need to figure out how to pull request back to the upstream and build the joplin plugin for myself untill it will be merged and released.
- also I will need to figure out how to batch commit each individual file and so the medium publisher could evaluate individual files.
