I'm fascinated by the world around me, though with limited time I've learned to focus on select passions. Reading is one of my greatest joys and time well spent. I'm drawn to both design and the challenge of solving programming puzzles. Film photography holds a special place in my heart - it's my analog escape from the digital world, allowing me to stay present in the moment.
