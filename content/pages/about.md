I'm a longtime VFX professional who's witnessed firsthand the challenges facing artists and studios in our industry. I've developed a passion for finding better ways to approach pipeline automation and studio operations.

I write about these experiences not as an expert with all the answers, but as someone who's made plenty of mistakes and is still learning. My hope is that by sharing these reflections, I might contribute to conversations about creating more sustainable and fulfilling creative environments for all of us working in digital production.
